Abstract â€” Control strategies for cooperatively autonomous
driving vehicles are becoming more and more complex to ensure
safe operation while, when taking inspiration from nature, more
simple mathematical descriptions exist which describe behaviour
of animals moving in a flocking or herding manner. In the eighties
Reynolds came up with a set of heuristic rules [1] which form a
model for flocking behaviour of birds and his work has been an
inspiration for constructing a control strategy based on flocking
behaviour for self-driving vehicles. Previous research relied on
more simple kinematic models of vehicles and thus using it
directly in real vehicles would be difficult. This research provides
an algorithm inspired by flocking behaviour as found in swarms
of birds and a bridge between said algorithm and a vehicle. A
dedicated simulation environment which uses parallelism on a
GPU is written and is used to determine the performance of
the proposed algorithm. It is found that the proposed algorithm
performs relatively well under the tested situations and is found
that a wide range of parameters could be used which result in
stable behaviour.
